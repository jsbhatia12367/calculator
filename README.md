Introduction:
In this project, our aim is to develop a basic calculator (with four arithmetic functionalities: Subtraction, Multiplication,Division and Addition) in Java using DevOps tools like Apache Maven as a build tool, GitHub for source code management Jenkins for Continuous integration and Rundeck for continuous deployment.
Thus, fully automate the process.

Tools and Technologies:
1.  Programming Language: Java
2.  Build tool: Apache Maven
3.  Source Code Management: GitHub for Git
4.  Continuous Integration: Jenkins
5.  Automatic deployment in container: Docker
6.  Continuous Deployment:  Rundeck

Project Steps :
1. Writing source code in Java.
2. Configure the project in Apache Maven
3. Host the project on GitHub
4. Create an automated pipeline using Jenkins
5. Docker integration with Jenkins project
6. Rundeck integration with Jenkins project
